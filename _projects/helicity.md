Scattering amplitude is the most important quantity in particle physics experiments. The standard way of calculating the scattering amplitude for a process is by drawing Feynman diagrams, using Feynman rules to find the invariant amplitude, summing over the external spin states, converting the spin sum into a trace and using trace theorems to evaluate the trace. If a process has $$ N $$ possible Feynman diagrams then the square of the amplitude will contain $$ N^2 $$ terms. This standard method becomes cumbersome for complex processes. Such extensive calculations can be managed by using the Helicity amplitude technique. In Helicity Amplitude method, the scattering process is decomposed into scattering of helicity eigenstates for which it is simpler to calculate the helicity amplitudes. The individual helicity amplitudes are summed and squared to get the amplitude for the process. In certain situations this greatly simplifies the scattering cross section calculation.
