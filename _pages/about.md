I am a physics student at UM-DAE-Center for Excellence in Basic Sciences and consider myself a theoretical physicist. I am interested in physics, mathematics  and computation. When I am not thinking about physics, I will be playing football, chess or speedcubing. You can find my blogs in the [blog page](/blog). You can see the interesting projects that I have done in the [projects page](/projects).
